Reversi, also known as Othello, is a classic strategy board game for two players. The game is played on an 8x8 grid and the objective is to have the majority of your colored discs on the board when the game ends. The code was designed using an MVC architecture and can be played against a human opponent or the computer which uses the minimax algorithm to optimize it's moves.

This repository contains an implementation of Reversi in Python.
